My favroite Apps:
Youtube and weather app

Youtube because I see video that related to what I like to watch and almost endless vide to watch

Weather app because I alway check the weather before I go fishing and I can check the tide as well for the boynton inlet pier.


Plan to make an app where user can
Check the weather/tide at a certain pier/inlet
Allow people to report if there bait fish around like mullet or greenies
Allow people to report if certain species of fish are around (spanish mackeral or blue fish)
