Fishermen Live bait reporting app

Got Live Bait?

What:
The App is for Fishermen who like to use live bait that they can caught themselves instead of buying frozen or alive bait from a bait shop. So, user can report if there current bait around a spot. So, isntead of driving around to find where the bait fish around. The user can open the app and see where people spotted live bait at. Also, have API that show the current weather and tide at a current location. 2nd API is allow user to take photo of their caught and get API/AI to identify the fish. So, they can know what type of fish it is and if it legal to be kept.

Who: The Target audience is for saltwater fishermen and even non-local that new to fishing or not around florida (for the API/AI taking photo of the fish and having the API/AI identify the fish.)
Why: I had app idea similar to this already. I was waiting to learn more to code before developing my app. Already own the domain Gotlivebait. I love fishing myself and would be great if I can know where the bait fish at where I go fishing. So, I can decide which spot to go. I was going make this app either way anyway.

Challenges:
Potential obstacles would be getting new users to reported if there bait fish around. Then also dealing with people falsing reporting. But programming challenges is having the two API working together. Since going have weather and ocean tide API going be used at once. Plus, know if what address or cord it willing to take. Since it could be gps or zip code or address the API accept to give  back an respond. But definitly going be interesting to see how well the API that scan photo and identify species of fish. Not everyone going have same camera or photo quality.
